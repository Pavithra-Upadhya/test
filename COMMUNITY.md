# Inner Source Community

This page is intended to provide the links to those repositories that are encouraging contribution, whether it be driven from capability leadership or individual practicitioners. We want to make sure those projects are visible above the rest. Many of the sections below are placeholders, which we hope the community will help fill in. Where possible- let's try to make code available that is already written!

# Capability Leadership Recommendations

This section provides a means for CC Leadership to convey important projects to practictioners in the community. Please leave for CC Leads to modify.

- [Shell.Translate.Web](https://github.com/sede-x/Shell.Translate.Web)
  - The Shell Web Translator is used to provide secure translation facilities for Shell. In the past, web-based public translation utilities (e.g. Google Translate) posed risks to Shell's information, so this helps to fill the gap to prevent leakage of confidential data.
  - This project is setup an example of how inner source should be done- it provides the structure and documentation to make it easy to get started, the branching and pipeline to minimize issues introduced, and it is welcoming to anyone that wants to review or contribute.

- React Client Framework (TBA)
  - The Client Framework is a React-based framework that accelerates the start-up of new mobile and web applications. It integrates Shell branding and styles to make it easy to get up and running, and stay compliant with reduced effort.
  - The Client Framework will be one of the first foundational elements of native software engineering, made available for everyone in the coming months to use, review, and contribute.
